- 👋 Hi, I’m @The-Black-Owl, As a physicist by education, I've always been drawn to the intricate workings of the universe and the elegance of scientific exploration. However, my professional journey has taken an exciting turn towards the realms of technology and software development.
- My goal is to specialize in full-stack development, leveraging the power of Java, Angular, and Python to create innovative and efficient solutions. I'm passionate about crafting seamless REST APIs, diving into the realms of data science, and exploring the fascinating world of robotics. Driven by a curiosity to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and technological innovation, I aspire to combine my foundational understanding of physics with cutting-edge programming skills to contribute meaningfully to the fields of software engineering, data analysis, and robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Java 17, Spring, Springboot and Angular
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment...
